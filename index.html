                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Zidane. I'm a student and aspiring robotics engineer from Singapore, passionate about the arts and my goal to grow as an engineer.
                        My long-term goal is to contribute and develop projects that are not just technically functional, but also provide value to society.
                        I believe the best robotic solutions should feel like a natural extension of our own capabilities, to remain human-centric.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Driven by a deep curiosity, I'm always learning and drawing inspiration from diverse experiences. 
                        I take every opportunity to grow that presents itself today as experience to evolve myself tomorrow.
                        This approach allows me to grow and develop a wide, well-rounded perspective and find creative, effective solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Feel free to explore my portfolio for a detailed look at my skills and professional background, you can view my current qualifications. 
                        Let's connect and talk about the future.
                    </p>
